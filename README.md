# palgrad

`palgrad` creates color gradients and palettes from user input colors.

Gradients are created in `Lch` color space (also known as `HCL`), the cylindrical representaiton of the `Lab` or `L*a*b*` color space. Using this color space, gradients are generally more vibrant and visually appealing than other spaces like `HSV` or `RGB`.

Some ideas for using the output:
- gamut masking
- pixelization to make more color swatches
- bring into digital painting programs to color pick from as limited palettes and apply more filters
- website/application color themes
